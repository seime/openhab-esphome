# ESPHome Native API Binding

![logo](logo.png)

This binding makes [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) devices available in openHAB through the ESPHome Home Assistant Native
API. This is an
alternative to using MQTT and/or running Home Assistant in addition to openHAB.

It does _NOT_ provide any webpage for managing the ESP themselves. Use
the [ESPHome dashboard](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome.html) for that.

Benefits of using the native API over MQTT:

- State descriptions on openHAB channels with value options
- No need for an MQTT broker
- Slightly faster than messaging over MQTT (according to the ESPHome documentation)

## Getting started for non ESPHome users

1. [Install ESPHome](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome)
2. Create an ESPHome configuration for your device
3. Flash the device with the ESPHome firmware
4. Install the ESPHome binding in openHAB https://github.com/seime/openhab-esphome/releases/tag/latest_oh4
5. Wait for discovery to find your device - or add manually in a thing file.

> **Note:** At the current state of the binding, it is highly recommended to use file based configuration for things and
> items as channel types etc most likely will change.

## Streaming device logs

As an alternative to manually streaming device logs via ESPHome dashboard, you can have openHAB stream
the device logs directly to openHAB - which will write them using the standard log system.

1. Make sure your ESPHome yaml is configured with a log level that produces the logs you want to see.
   See https://esphome.io/components/logger.html
2. Configure the `deviceLogLevel` parameter on the `thing` configuration. Valid
   values: https://esphome.io/components/logger.html#log-levels

This will produce logs on level `INFO` in the openHAB logs like this:

```
[2024-04-04 15:06:25.822] [varmtvann] [D][dallas.sensor:143]: 'VV Temp bunn': Got Temperature=21.0째C
[2024-04-04 15:06:25.834] [varmtvann] [D][sensor:094]: 'VV Temp bunn': Sending state 21.00000 째C with 1 decimals of accuracy
[2024-04-04 15:06:25.850] [varmtvann] [D][dallas.sensor:143]: 'VV Temp midt': Got Temperature=71.7째C
[2024-04-04 15:06:25.863] [varmtvann] [D][sensor:094]: 'VV Temp midt': Sending state 71.68750 째C with 1 decimals of accuracy
```

To redirect device logs to a separate log file, edit your `log4j.xml` file and add the following in the `Appenders`
section:

```xml

<RollingFile fileName="${sys:openhab.logdir}/esphomedevice.log"
             filePattern="${sys:openhab.logdir}/esphomedevice.log.%i" name="ESPHOMEDEVICE">
    <PatternLayout pattern="[%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}] %m%n"/>
    <Policies>
        <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="32 MB"/>
    </Policies>
</RollingFile>
```

And add the following in the `Loggers` section:

```xml

<Logger additivity="false" level="INFO" name="ESPHOMEDEVICE">
    <AppenderRef ref="ESPHOMEDEVICE"/>
</Logger>
```

## Sending state from openHAB to ESPHome

You can send state to the ESPHome device using the `homeassistant` channel type. Only `entity_id` field is used.

You can listen for several types of OpenHAB events, default is `ItemStateChangedEvent`. The following are supported:

| entity_id                                  | OH Event listened for         | Item/Thing   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| `<whatever>.ItemName`                      | `ItemStateChangedEvent`       | ItemName     | 
| `ItemStateChangedEvent.ItemName`           | `ItemStateChangedEvent`       | ItemName     | 
| `ItemStateEvent.ItemName`                  | `ItemStateEvent`              | ItemName     | 
| `ItemStatePredictedEvent.ItemName`         | `ItemStatePredictedEvent`     | ItemName     | 
| `ThingStatusInfoEvent.my_thing_uid`        | `ThingStatusInfoEvent`        | my:thing:uid | 
| `ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent.my_thing_uid` | `ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent` | my:thing:uid | 

> NOTE: EntityID in HA is case-insensitive - meaning only lowercase is used. Whatever you add in `entity_id` in the
> ESPHome yaml will be converted to lowercase.
> In OH item names are case-sensitive, so you > can have 2 items like `MYITEM` and `MyItem`, and we cannot distinguish
> between the 2. Avoid this setup.

> NOTE2: In Thing UIDs, the `:` is replaced with `_`

### Examples

Making state changes to OH temperature sensor available in ESPHome:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    name: "Outside temperature"
    entity_id: ItemStateChangedEvent.MyTemperatureItem
    device_class: temperature
```

Listening for commands sent from OH to some OH item and making it available in ESPHome:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    name: "Flower watering activating"
    entity_id: ItemCommandEvent.WaterValve_Switch
```

Making ESPHome device react when a Thing changes status, ie goes offline/online:

```yaml
text_sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    name: "ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent"
    entity_id: ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent.astro_moon_local
```

## Time sync

Time sync from your openHAB server is supported using
the [HomeAssistant time source component](https://esphome.io/components/time/homeassistant).

```yaml
time:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: openhab_time
```

## FAQ

- I get warnings
  like `No device_class reported by sensor '<name of sensor>'. Add device_class to sensor configuration in ESPHome. Defaulting to plain Number without dimension`

  > This is because the ESP sensor does not report a `device_class`. This field is used to determine item and category
  > type in openHAB.
  > Solution: Specify a `device_class` to your ESPHome configuration. Example: <br/>
  > ![img.png](esphomeconfig_deviceclass.png)
  > <br/>See https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/#available-device-classes for valid
  device_class values (**use lowercase values**)
  > Also note that you may override `device_class: ""` to remove any device class from the sensor.

## Limitations as of 2024-03-28

- The following entity types are supported
    - `sensor`,
    - `binary_sensor`,
    - `text_sensor`
    - `switch`,
    - `number`,
    - `button`,
    - `cover`,
    - `light` (some advanced configurations may not be supported yet),
    - `climate`
    - `select`
    - `homeassistant` see [details here](#sending-state-from-openhab-to-esphome)

      Plans to add more, but not yet implemented. I need _your_ help.

## Discovery

The binding uses mDNS to automatically discover devices on the network.
